       engine.say("Now,When it comes to the vietnam war against the USA, you have to keep in mind only one thing, that, there firstly was  a conflict in which the northern past of Vietnam and the southern part of vietnam were supposed to be combined together. Why was this the case? It is simply because the southern part of vienam was living in poor conditions, the king of the southern part of vietnam was also not treating the people in the southern part of vietnam in a good way as he would kill anybody who went against him. So, there was a meeting then between the UDF who were from the northern part of vietnam and the king of the south, Ngo Dihn Diem. This meeting was held because the COF wanted to ease the situation by asking Ngo Dihn Diem to allow the northern part of Vietnam and the Southern part of vietnam. However, Ngo Dihn Diem refused to make that happen. As a result the meeting was a failure. Then the UDF decide to take matters into its own hands by training soldiers who were commonly known as the Vietcong soldiers. The vietcong soldiers were sent to take down Ngo Dihn Diem and as a result, they managed to take him down. Now the southern part of Vietnam was under the control of these vietcong soldiers. So, what did the vietcong soldiers do then? They decided to create an underground tunnel callled the HO CHI MIHN TRILL. This tunnel was specifically created to help import goods and resources and food from the North to the south so that the people from the South would live much better. As a result, the leadership of the Vietcong soldiers, the people from the Southern part of Vietnam were living happily. What actually made the vietcong soldiers to be so effective, it was simply because they received full support from the USSR and China. They would receive anything from weapons, resources and many more from them, in order for them to be able to fight against USA which was highly against this arrangement of Vietnam as they feared that, communism would spread out the whole world. Then the USA decided to take action against this arrangement. The president of USA who was called, president Johnson decided to make an attempt to destroy the underground tunnel the Vietcong soldiers had been using to transport or import resources from the North. So he decided to throw bombs in the forest where he believed was located the HO CHI MIHN TRILL. Unfortunately this attempt was a failure as the bombs instead  damaged the wrong spots and damaged a lot of houses. Therfore this was a huge disgrace coming the USA." + b + "You have to understand that the USA made a lot of poor attempts which failed throughout this whole war. So what did president Johnson decide to do? He decided to use some chemicals to try and destroy the vietcong soldiers in the forests, which was also such an unfortunate thing to do because, these chemicals instead harmed and killed a lot of innocent people instead of the Vietcong soldiers. Therfore consequently, a lot of countries from around the world were so dissapointed from USA. This then as a result, led to the stepping down of president Johnson as president. Finaly on the year 1975, on the 30th of January, the Vietcong soldiers decided to finalise the whole war. On this day, it was when the Vietcong soldiers were holding a lot of funerals. They used the coffins and caskets to hide a lot of weapons which they used to succesfully attack all the air bases in the USA. This as a result, caused the United States to give up and be defeated. The war between the Vietcong and the USA lastly led to the official combination of the northern part of vietnam and the southern part of vietnam. This also led to the implementation of communism in the southern part of vietnam.")

The reason why they were under such negative conditions happens to be the fact that, there was violence which was imposed upon the blacks by the poslice, by the KKK and so on. Black americans were killed each and evryday by the police force and the KKK. There were also laws which were imposed against the blacks by the police which were aimed at oppressing the balcks. The blacks were also receiving low wages compared to the whites. They were also denied job opportunities because of how inferior they were considered to be. Now, some people , blacks americans decided that, they need to stand up against such conditions and help ease the conditions and violence, along with the oppressions that were faced by the black Americans. So, that's when the black power movement was formed, was established. Well at first a leader who went by the name Martin Luther King emphasized that, peace can only be acquired without the use of violence. Howver, his approach was quite slow and was yielding poor results. So, what happened there on? A group of individuals such as Bobby and Newton simply formed a party of which they called, the black panther party. This party was going to fight agaist such conditions which were faced by the black americans. The balck panther party decided to form patrol groups, which would carrry guns and  weapons in order to protect the black Americans. As a result of this, the blacks were now feeling much more safe from the KKK and the violence imposed by the police. The KKK would get involved in shootouts with the police accross a lot of cities in America ,  as part of their mission. Now, lets talk a bit more about some of the members who were considered highly influential in all this movement. There was  a guy who went by the name Malcolm X. He instead came up with a different approach, an approach which would involve violence. Hence why he promoted the violence and retaliation methods which the black panther party was using, which was ,violence. His approach of violence was quite effective as change and progress was not slow against the oppresions faced by the black Americans. This movement was at this point considered as a greate threat against the whites to such a point that, Newton, one of the individuals who were behind the black panther party, was arrested for shooting and killing a police official. Now, party, had a ten point programme. In this programme they demanded equal job opportunities for the balck Americans, they had demande the KKK to stop violating the black americans, they also demanded the release of Black americans who were arrested for fighting for their rights, such as Rosa Parks. This programme was a very much greate success. The balck panther party also created other programmes which would help empower the societies of black Americans. These were were the healthcare facilities for black Americans, they also included the food programmes which would help provide breakfast for the balcks. They also included skills development programmes such as literacy skills to the black Americans. As a result of such programmes, the conditions faced by the black americans were now starting to improve because of the black panther party. Lastly, another influential individual was Stockey Carmichiel. He promoted that  blacks take pride in themselves, their heritage and their unique identity.")

       engine.say("For you to understand the black consciousness movement, you have to remember how it all started after the coming of PW Botha into power who introduced his total strategy. At this time, in the country, races such as indians, coloreds and blacks were not granted any rights outside their homelands. This was all to ensure that, the whites still remained at the top and superior compared to all the other races. At this time around these races were using violence to respond to such bad conditions which were imposed upon them by the  white goverment. As a result of this violence, the white goverment ensured that it bans ANC and PAC which were underground organizations. Leaders of such organizations were also sent into exile. The white goverment proceeded by introducing the terrorism act, which ensured that, it keeps the whites more powerful than all the other races. Then the goverment also ensured that it introduced the bantu education, which was to ensure that blacks received insufficient education, or poor education compared to whites. Basically, the apartheid goverment was in full control, suppressing the other races. This is the background information that will help you get a clear sense of how the BCM was formed. So here's the most important part. Well within the universities which were founded by the bantu education, there were a group of students who decided to show resistance against the apartheid goverment. Such students were the likes of Steve Biko. They were all part of a group they called NUSAS. Now, the problem with NUSAS is the fact that, it also involved white students. Steve Biko then was convinced that the whites would not really understand the issues faced by the blacks, coloreds and indians. So as a result, he decided to withdraw from NUSAS and formed his own organisation called SASO. SASO was only consisting of black students from around the universities such as University of Zululand. SASO then got to form its own philosophy. They believed the blacks and other races were supposed to be restored their identity. Steve Biko made all the other members to believe that, blacks and coloreds and Indians had to be free psychology. Biko believd that, blacks were supposed to take pride in themselves and their skin color and ways of thinking. He believd that blacks were supposed to fight for self liberation. So, Im sure you are wondering how did the apartheid goverment respond to this movement. Well the govement thought that, the black consciousness movement was a philosophy which would have no direct political impact. Now after that, it was really obvious that the black consciousness movemt was gaining a lot of power and recognition. Speeches were being made around the country by the members such as Steve Biko that, people should stand up and fight against the apartheid regime. The goverment was now aware that the movement was really posing as a threat. As a result of this intensity, a lot of people from around the country were now in support of the movement. We also have to keep in mind that, Steve Biko and many of his fello SASO members were expelled from universities as they were the ones who were behind all this. There was also another organisation which was formed called the South African Students Movement. It was instead full of school children especially from Soweto during the 1970s. These school children during 1976 deicded to form a march and protests down the streets of Soweto fighting against oppressions they faced in schools such as having to learn all their languages in Affrikkans. During their march on the 16th of June 1976, they were faced with a devastating incident as they were shot at by the police. As a result of this massacre, the blacks around the country resorted to protests nation wide. These protests included everything from boycotts and the damaging of the goverment's proprty such as offices and buildings. People were highly furious because of the incident that happened on the day of the 16th of June 1976. We should also keep in mind that, a lot students decided to join ANC and PAC in exile which also were on their own mission of fighting against the apartheid goverment. They received military training which helped them to be prepared for the missions which were executed by ANC and PAC in order to sabotage the goverment.")
